# Vehicle Diagnostics Dashboard

An educational project to learn **JavaScript and Node.js** by building a simulated automotive diagnostics system step by step.  
The goal is to simulate how a vehicle’s Electronic Control Unit (ECU) might provide data like speed, RPM, and temperature, then display it in a browser dashboard.

---

## 📌 Project Goals
- Learn modern JavaScript (frontend + backend with Node.js).
- Build features incrementally every 2 days.
- At the end of each 1–2 week cycle, deliver a complete feature.
- Use automotive-inspired examples (e.g., vehicle telemetry, fault codes) without proprietary APIs.

---

## 🚀 Current Feature (Week 1–2)
**Vehicle Diagnostics Dashboard Prototype**  
- Frontend: Displays simulated vehicle data (speed, RPM, temperature).
- Backend: Node.js generates and serves data via a simple API.
- Integration: Frontend fetches backend data and visualizes it (e.g., live chart of speed history).
